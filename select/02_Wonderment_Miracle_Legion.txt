I want to go
Right where you want to leave me
I want to spread out the days
And make them last completely
Cause when you touch me on the head
You leave me shaking all day in your bed

Just holding my breath
And wishing that you never left

I could care less
When I'm holding onto your wrist
Cause the things that work and work either work or they don't
Need to be fixed

Cause I want to be in love
Before I leave this world
I want to be in love
And I wonder will it be a girl

But for now I'm just looking around
I find myself just looking around
Looking around looking around looking around looking around

Cause I want to be in love
Before I leave this world
I want to be in love
And I wonder will it be a girl
